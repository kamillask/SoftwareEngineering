# Tip Calculator

This is a simple Java tip calculator written in Android Studio.

Check Amount takes in the total value of the check. (Value must be greater than zero.)

Party Size takes in the number of people who are splitting up the check. (Value must be greater than zero.)

Clicking on Compute Tip will return the values for the different percentages of tips.

The Tip row represents how much each person is paying in the tip alone, and the Total row represents how much each person is paying total, including tip.
